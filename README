TCInstapaper.h is a very small, light and super easy to use Instapaper Objective-C wrapper for iOS and Mac OS (last one is not tested tho).

Usage
=====

Simply make reference to files from your Xcode project, include "TCInstapaper.h" where necessary and start using.

TCInstapaper *ip = [[TCInstapaper alloc] initWithUsername:@"username" andPassword:@"password"];
ip.delegate = self;

You can pass nil instead of password if your your Instapaper account has not got one.

Two basic methods provide your functionality:

[ip authenticate] will make authentication request check weather you've provided correct username and password.

[ip addURLString:@"http://140plus.totocaster.com"];
[ip addURLString:@"http://140plus.totocaster.com" title:@"My Website"]; 

Both will add your link to Instapaper with your automatically detected web-site name or your own custom one.

All API calls will invoke delegate method: 

- (void)instapaper:(TCInstapaper *)instapaper didDidFinishRequestWithCode:(NSUInteger)code;

(TCInstapaper *)instapaper - is object which called delegate
(NSUInteger)code â€“ is a HTTP status code from Instapaper.

Instapaper HTTP status codes:
200 - Authentication OK
201 - This URL has been successfully added to this Instapaper account.
403 - Invalid username or password.
400 - Bad request or exceeded the rate limit. Probably missing a required parameter, such as url.
500 - The service encountered an error. Please try again later.
